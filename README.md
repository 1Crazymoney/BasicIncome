# BasicIncome
Crypto UBI

Tenqido is a quasi DAO. 

Crypto Basic Income can and should exist. 

Perhaps multiple cryptocurrency basic incomes can co-exist. 

Bright ID is a project to prevent sybil problems that can occur in the practice of implementing a cryptocurrency basic income. 

Manna is a cryptocurrency basic income that has paused distrubitions currently; August 2020 is the current month and year. It is unclear when Manna distrobutions will resume.

Perhaps if multiple cryptocurrency basic income projects exist and all have some success, then humans on Earth can recieve multiple sources of crypto UBI distrobutions that may be less significant monetarily individually, however, they may collectively be an effective basic income that helps billions of humans on Earth. 

Bitcoin Cash enables the creation of Bitcoin Cash Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) Tokens. These tokens enjoy the security and low transacation fees of Bitcoin Cash, while also offering cryptocurrency token functionality. 

Michael Ten, a director of Tenqido, is embarking on a pilot project to implement cryptocurrency basic income to those verified as unique humans via the Bright ID project. 

If you feel called to, please fork and replicate this project in your own style.
